                        According to me every one on the earth will have a rhythm in their brain, its actually the flow how they think about everything.

                        Everybody's brain will have a different flow of ideas(different rhythms).If there are seventy members in a class no two people will think in the same way ,that is every brain will have its own rhythm.
