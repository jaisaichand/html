                    <p style="padding: 0px 167px;">Note 9 is a perfect flagship mobile from samsung in note series, it has heart rate sensor at back. Not only that but also it has iris scanner at front which ensures a secure way of biometric unlock. Both of the cameras it has in the back has optical image stabilization. That's it? No. It has variable aperature camera which can adjust the aperature which helps the image sensor to take only the necessery amount of light inside.</p>
                    <p style="padding: 0px 167px;">It does not have an hole punch that might take some information out of user's sight, It has a massive 500+ PPI, which is greater than its successor note 10. A lot of people think this is an old mobile and its not that good of a deal to buy it in 2019. But remember it is built with complete flagship qualities such as aluminium and glass sandwich which includes wireless charging also it is coming now with bluetooth support to S-pen which can charge in 40 seconds and can work upto 30 minutes. </p>
                    <p style="padding: 0px 167px;">It comes with 8GB ram and now its going to get ONE UI 2.0</p>

                        Hi guys,This is jai's pr theory proposed by me so it carry my name
                        
                        
                        First i will explain about the title
                        
                        
                        P-perception
                        
                        R-rhythm
                        
                        
                        According to me every one on the earth will have a rhythm in their brain, its actually the flow how they think about everything.
                        
                        Everybody's brain will have a different flow of ideas(different rhythms).If there are seventy members in a class no two people will think in the same way ,that is
                         every brain will have its own rhythm.
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        Now lets get into theory
                        
                        
                          We make friends with others when we feel that the other person is not effecting or disturbing our rhythm 
                        
                        
                        Example 1:Assume that you are studying or preparing for a test then some one just sat beside you , then your perception about him is totally zero.
                        
                        That means you dont know about him so initially your perception about that person will be neutral
                        
                                   
                        
                                        And now he starts to disturb you while you are studying , like asking time, talking unnecessarily and distracting you from studying then your
                                         rhythm in brain gets disturbs and the perception about him in your mind will changes from neutral to negative  
                        
                        
                        Example 2: Now we take another example, did you ever noticed your speed of walking when you are walking alone 
                        
                         And now try to recall the speed of walking when you are chatting and walking with your friend ,it differs because you both should walk in a same speed , 
                         so that you both can walk and talk at a time
                        
                        So that means that both of your rhythms must be coincide to walk at same speed 
                        
                        
                        
                        Example 3: When you are driving on a road with a peaceful music 
                        
                        and then when someone sounds the horn repeatedly then the
                        rhythm in brain will get disturbed and our perception about the person who is blowing horn will be going to negative
                        
                        
                        
                        Now lets talk about emotions:
                        
                        
                        Irritation: How do we get anger? whenever we are in a work land someone disturbs our work like in example 1 above we get irritated.
                        
                        
                        Anger: And when the irritation is again and again hit we get anger
                        
                        that means,when our brain's rhythm is disturbed frequently by others we get anger.
                        
                        
                        Love: whenever we look at a person and there goes our first look impression, its nothing but our perception about that person goes to positive by looks and to this
                         when we talk to that person and your brain's rhythm gets comforted while talking or spending time with that person, so if your rhythm gets satisfied so does your
                          perception and thats what love is.
                        
                        
                        
                        like this almost everything and all human interactions and thinking in this world will work like this ,rhythm and perception.
                        
                        
                        So thats jai's pr theory   
                        
                        
                        
                </pre>
